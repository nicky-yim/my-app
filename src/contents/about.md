### Hey, I'm Nicky Yim.

I'm a software engineer from Toronto, who specializes in front-end development. I began my journey as an **`ASP.NET C#`** software developer.

Lately, I've been learning **`React`** in my free time. This site is proudly built by myself using **`Gatsby`**, a static site generating framework based on **`React`**!

Things I've been working with recently:

 - `ASP.NET`
 - `C#`
 - `HTML & (S)CSS`
 - `JavaScript (ES6+)`
 - `React`
 - `Gatsby`
